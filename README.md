# ⌨️ Auto Text Effect Animation

A smooth and elegant auto-typing text animation that cycles through different career titles with a typewriter effect. Perfect for personal portfolios, landing pages, or any website that needs an eye-catching text animation.

## 🌟 Features

- **Typewriter Effect**: Characters appear one by one creating a realistic typing animation
- **Career Cycling**: Automatically cycles through different career titles
- **Smart Grammar**: Dynamically uses "a" or "an" based on the first letter of each career
- **Smooth Transitions**: Seamless transition between different text strings
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on all screen sizes
- **Clean UI**: Minimalist design with elegant typography

## 🚀 Demo

Watch as the text dynamically types out:
- "I am a Youtuber"
- "I am a Web Developer" 
- "I am a Freelancer"
- "I am an Instructor"

The animation continuously loops through these careers with a smooth typewriter effect!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with Flexbox and Google Fonts
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Dynamic text manipulation and timing
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins font family for beautiful typography

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Text Array**: Stores an array of career titles to cycle through
2. **Character Indexing**: Tracks the current character position in each word
3. **Career Indexing**: Tracks which career title is currently being displayed
4. **Smart Grammar**: Automatically chooses "a" or "an" based on vowel detection
5. **Recursive Animation**: Uses setTimeout to create smooth character-by-character typing
6. **Loop Logic**: Automatically resets to the first career after completing the cycle
